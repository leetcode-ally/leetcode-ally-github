      "content": "<p>Given an integer array <code>nums</code> sorted in <strong>non-decreasing order</strong>, remove the duplicates <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>in-place</strong></a> such that each unique element appears only <strong>once</strong>. The <strong>relative order</strong> of the elements should be kept the <strong>same</strong>. Then return <em>the number of unique elements in </em><code>nums</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the number of unique elements of <code>nums</code> to be <code>k</code>, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Change the array <code>nums</code> such that the first <code>k</code> elements of <code>nums</code> contain the unique elements in the order they were present in <code>nums</code> initially. The remaining elements of <code>nums</code> are not important as well as the size of <code>nums</code>.</li>\n\t<li>Return <code>k</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Custom Judge:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The judge will test your solution with the following code:</p>\n\n<pre>\nint[] nums = [...]; // Input array\nint[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length\n\nint k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation\n\nassert k == expectedNums.length;\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; k; i++) {\n    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];\n}\n</pre>\n\n<p>If all assertions pass, then your solution will be <strong>accepted</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [1,1,2]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 2, nums = [1,2,_]\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.\nIt does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.\nIt does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>\n\t<li><code>-100 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 100</code></li>\n\t<li><code>nums</code> is sorted in <strong>non-decreasing</strong> order.</li>\n</ul>\n",
