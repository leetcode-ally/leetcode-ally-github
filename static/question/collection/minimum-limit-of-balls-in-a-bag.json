      "content": "<p>You are given an integer array <code>nums</code> where the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> bag contains <code>nums[i]</code> balls. You are also given an integer <code>maxOperations</code>.</p>\n\n<p>You can perform the following operation at most <code>maxOperations</code> times:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Take any bag of balls and divide it into two new bags with a <strong>positive </strong>number of balls.\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>For example, a bag of <code>5</code> balls can become two new bags of <code>1</code> and <code>4</code> balls, or two new bags of <code>2</code> and <code>3</code> balls.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Your penalty is the <strong>maximum</strong> number of balls in a bag.
