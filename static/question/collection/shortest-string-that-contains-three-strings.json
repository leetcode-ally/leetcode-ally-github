            "content": "Given three strings <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>, your task is to find a string that has the<strong> minimum</strong> length and contains all three strings as <strong>substrings</strong>.\n<p>If there are multiple such strings, return the<em> </em><strong>lexicographically<em> </em>smallest </strong>one.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>a string denoting the answer to the problem.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>A string <code>a</code> is <strong>lexicographically smaller</strong> than a string <code>b</code> (of the same length) if in the first position where <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> differ, string <code>a</code> has a letter that appears <strong>earlier </strong>in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in <code>b</code>.</li>\n\t<li>A <strong>substring</strong> is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> a = &quot;abc&quot;, b = &quot;bca&quot;, c = &quot;aaa&quot;\n<strong>Output:</strong> &quot;aaabca&quot;\n<strong>Explanation:</strong>  We show that &quot;aaabca&quot; contains all the given strings: a = ans[2...4], b = ans[3..5], c = ans[0..2]. It can be shown that the length of the resulting string would be at least 6 and &quot;aaabca&quot; is the lexicographically smallest one.</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> a = &quot;ab&quot;, b = &quot;ba&quot;, c = &quot;aba&quot;\n<strong>Output:</strong> &quot;aba&quot;\n<strong>Explanation: </strong>We show that the string &quot;aba&quot; contains all the given strings: a = ans[0..1], b = ans[1..2], c = ans[0..2]. Since the length of c is 3, the length of the resulting string would be at least 3.
