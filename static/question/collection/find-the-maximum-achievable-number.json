      "content": "<p>You are given two integers, <code>num</code> and <code>t</code>.</p>\n\n<p>An integer <code>x</code> is called <b>achievable</b> if it can become equal to <code>num</code> after applying the following operation no more than <code>t</code> times:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Increase or decrease <code>x</code> by <code>1</code>, and simultaneously increase or decrease <code>num</code> by <code>1</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Return <em>the maximum possible achievable number</em>. It can be proven that there exists at least one achievable number.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> num = 4, t = 1\n<strong>Output:</strong> 6\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The maximum achievable number is x = 6; it can become equal to num after performing this operation:\n1- Decrease x by 1, and increase num by 1. Now, x = 5 and num = 5. \nIt can be proven that there is no achievable number larger than 6.\n\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> num = 3, t = 2\n<strong>Output:</strong> 7\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The maximum achievable number is x = 7; after performing these operations, x will equal num: \n1- Decrease x by 1, and increase num by 1. Now, x = 6 and num = 4.\n2- Decrease x by 1, and increase num by 1. Now, x = 5 and num = 5.\nIt can be proven that there is no achievable number larger than 7.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= num, t&nbsp;&lt;= 50</code></li>\n</ul>\n",
