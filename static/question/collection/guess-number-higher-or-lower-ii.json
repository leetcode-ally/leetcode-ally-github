      "content": "<p>We are playing the Guessing Game. The game will work as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>I pick a number between&nbsp;<code>1</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>n</code>.</li>\n\t<li>You guess a number.</li>\n\t<li>If you guess the right number, <strong>you win the game</strong>.</li>\n\t<li>If you guess the wrong number, then I will tell you whether the number I picked is <strong>higher or lower</strong>, and you will continue guessing.</li>\n\t<li>Every time you guess a wrong number&nbsp;<code>x</code>, you will pay&nbsp;<code>x</code>&nbsp;dollars. If you run out of money, <strong>you lose the game</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Given a particular&nbsp;<code>n</code>, return&nbsp;<em>the minimum amount of money you need to&nbsp;<strong>guarantee a win regardless of what number I pick</strong></em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/10/graph.png\" style=\"width: 505px; height: 388px;\" />\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> n = 10\n<strong>Output:</strong> 16\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The winning strategy is as follows:\n- The range is [1,10]. Guess 7.\n&nbsp;   - If this is my number, your total is $0. Otherwise, you pay $7.\n&nbsp;   - If my number is higher, the range is [8,10]. Guess 9.\n&nbsp;       - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $9.\n&nbsp;       - If my number is higher, it must be 10. Guess 10. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.\n&nbsp;       - If my number is lower, it must be 8. Guess 8. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.\n&nbsp;   - If my number is lower, the range is [1,6]. Guess 3.\n&nbsp;       - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $3.\n&nbsp;       - If my number is higher, the range is [4,6]. Guess 5.\n&nbsp;           - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $5.\n&nbsp;           - If my number is higher, it must be 6. Guess 6. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.\n&nbsp;           - If my number is lower, it must be 4. Guess 4. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.\n&nbsp;       - If my number is lower, the range is [1,2]. Guess 1.\n&nbsp;           - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $1.\n&nbsp;           - If my number is higher, it must be 2. Guess 2. Your total is $7 + $3 + $1 = $11.\nThe worst case in all these scenarios is that you pay $16. Hence, you only need $16 to guarantee a win.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> n = 1\n<strong>Output:</strong> 0\n<strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;There is only one possible number, so you can guess 1 and not have to pay anything.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 3:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> n = 2\n<strong>Output:</strong> 1\n<strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;There are two possible numbers, 1 and 2.\n- Guess 1.\n&nbsp;   - If this is my number, your total is $0. Otherwise, you pay $1.\n&nbsp;   - If my number is higher, it must be 2. Guess 2. Your total is $1.\nThe worst case is that you pay $1.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 200</code></li>\n</ul>\n",
