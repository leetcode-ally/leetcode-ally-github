      "content": "<p>There is a donuts shop that bakes donuts in batches of <code>batchSize</code>. They have a rule where they must serve <strong>all</strong> of the donuts of a batch before serving any donuts of the next batch. You are given an integer <code>batchSize</code> and an integer array <code>groups</code>, where <code>groups[i]</code> denotes that there is a group of <code>groups[i]</code> customers that will visit the shop. Each customer will get exactly one donut.</p>\n\n<p>When a group visits the shop, all customers of the group must be served before serving any of the following groups. A group will be happy if they all get fresh donuts. That is, the first customer of the group does not receive a donut that was left over from the previous group.</p>\n\n<p>You can freely rearrange the ordering of the groups. Return <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> possible number of happy groups after rearranging the groups.</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> batchSize = 3, groups = [1,2,3,4,5,6]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 4\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> You can arrange the groups as [6,2,4,5,1,3]. Then the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, and 6<sup>th</sup> groups will be happy.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> batchSize = 4, groups = [1,3,2,5,2,2,1,6]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 4\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= batchSize &lt;= 9</code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= groups.length &lt;= 30</code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= groups[i] &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup></code></li>\n</ul>\n",
