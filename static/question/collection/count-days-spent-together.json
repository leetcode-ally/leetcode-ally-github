      "content": "<p>Alice and Bob are traveling to Rome for separate business meetings.</p>\n\n<p>You are given 4 strings <code>arriveAlice</code>, <code>leaveAlice</code>, <code>arriveBob</code>, and <code>leaveBob</code>. Alice will be in the city from the dates <code>arriveAlice</code> to <code>leaveAlice</code> (<strong>inclusive</strong>), while Bob will be in the city from the dates <code>arriveBob</code> to <code>leaveBob</code> (<strong>inclusive</strong>).
