All houses at this place are <strong>arranged in a circle.</strong> That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and&nbsp;<b>it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night</b>.</p>\n\n<p>Given an integer array <code>nums</code> representing the amount of money of each house, return <em>the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight <strong>without alerting the police</strong></em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [2,3,2]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 3\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [1,2,3,1]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 4\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).\nTotal amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 3:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [1,2,3]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 3\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 100</code></li>\n\t<li><code>0 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 1000</code></li>\n</ul>\n",
