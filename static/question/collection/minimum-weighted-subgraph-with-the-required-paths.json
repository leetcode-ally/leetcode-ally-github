      "content": "<p>You are given an integer <code>n</code> denoting the number of nodes of a <strong>weighted directed</strong> graph. The nodes are numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>.</p>\n\n<p>You are also given a 2D integer array <code>edges</code> where <code>edges[i] = [from<sub>i</sub>, to<sub>i</sub>, weight<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes that there exists a <strong>directed</strong> edge from <code>from<sub>i</sub></code> to <code>to<sub>i</sub></code> with weight <code>weight<sub>i</sub></code>.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, you are given three <strong>distinct</strong> integers <code>src1</code>, <code>src2</code>, and <code>dest</code> denoting three distinct nodes of the graph.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>the <strong>minimum weight</strong> of a subgraph of the graph such that it is <strong>possible</strong> to reach</em> <code>dest</code> <em>from both</em> <code>src1</code> <em>and</em> <code>src2</code> <em>via a set of edges of this subgraph</em>. In case such a subgraph does not exist, return <code>-1</code>.</p>\n\n<p>A <strong>subgraph</strong> is a graph whose vertices and edges are subsets of the original graph. The <strong>weight</strong> of a subgraph is the sum of weights of its constituent edges.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/02/17/example1drawio.png\" style=\"width: 263px; height: 250px;\" />\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> n = 6, edges = [[0,2,2],[0,5,6],[1,0,3],[1,4,5],[2,1,1],[2,3,3],[2,3,4],[3,4,2],[4,5,1]], src1 = 0, src2 = 1, dest = 5\n<strong>Output:</strong> 9\n<strong>Explanation:</strong>\nThe above figure represents the input graph.\nThe blue edges represent one of the subgraphs that yield the optimal answer.\nNote that the subgraph [[1,0,3],[0,5,6]] also yields the optimal answer.
