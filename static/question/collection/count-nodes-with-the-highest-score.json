      "content": "<p>There is a <strong>binary</strong> tree rooted at <code>0</code> consisting of <code>n</code> nodes. The nodes are labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>. You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>parents</code> representing the tree, where <code>parents[i]</code> is the parent of node <code>i</code>. Since node <code>0</code> is the root, <code>parents[0] == -1</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Each node has a <strong>score</strong>. To find the score of a node, consider if the node and the edges connected to it were <strong>removed</strong>. The tree would become one or more <strong>non-empty</strong> subtrees. The <strong>size</strong> of a subtree is the number of the nodes in it. The <strong>score</strong> of the node is the <strong>product of the sizes</strong> of all those subtrees.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>the <strong>number</strong> of nodes that have the <strong>highest score</strong></em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"example-1\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/03/example-1.png\" style=\"width: 604px; height: 266px;\" />\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> parents = [-1,2,0,2,0]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 3\n<strong>Explanation:</strong>\n- The score of node 0 is: 3 * 1 = 3\n- The score of node 1 is: 4 = 4\n- The score of node 2 is: 1 * 1 * 2 = 2\n- The score of node 3 is: 4 = 4\n- The score of node 4 is: 4 = 4\nThe highest score is 4, and three nodes (node 1, node 3, and node 4) have the highest score.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"example-2\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/03/example-2.png\" style=\"width: 95px; height: 143px;\" />\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> parents = [-1,2,0]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 2\n<strong>Explanation:</strong>\n- The score of node 0 is: 2 = 2\n- The score of node 1 is: 2 = 2\n- The score of node 2 is: 1 * 1 = 1\nThe highest score is 2, and two nodes (node 0 and node 1) have the highest score.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>n == parents.length</code></li>\n\t<li><code>2 &lt;= n &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>\n\t<li><code>parents[0] == -1</code></li>\n\t<li><code>0 &lt;= parents[i] &lt;= n - 1</code> for <code>i != 0</code></li>\n\t<li><code>parents</code> represents a valid binary tree.</li>\n</ul>\n",
