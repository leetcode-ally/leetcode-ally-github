      "content": "<p>Given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> string <code>s</code>, repeatedly perform the following operation <strong>any</strong> number of times:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Choose an index <code>i</code> in the string, and let <code>c</code> be the character in position <code>i</code>. <strong>Delete</strong> the <strong>closest occurrence</strong> of <code>c</code> to the <strong>left</strong> of <code>i</code> (if any) and the <strong>closest occurrence</strong> of <code>c</code> to the <strong>right</strong> of <code>i</code> (if any).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Your task is to <strong>minimize</strong> the length of <code>s</code> by performing the above operation any number of times.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>an integer denoting the length of the <strong>minimized</strong> string.</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;aaabc&quot;\n<strong>Output:</strong> 3\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> In this example, s is &quot;aaabc&quot;. We can start by selecting the character &#39;a&#39; at index 1. We then remove the closest &#39;a&#39; to the left of index 1, which is at index 0, and the closest &#39;a&#39; to the right of index 1, which is at index 2. After this operation, the string becomes &quot;abc&quot;. Any further operation we perform on the string will leave it unchanged. Therefore, the length of the minimized string is 3.</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;cbbd&quot;\n<strong>Output:</strong> 3\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> For this we can start with character &#39;b&#39; at index 1. There is no occurrence of &#39;b&#39; to the left of index 1, but there is one to the right at index 2, so we delete the &#39;b&#39; at index 2. The string becomes &quot;cbd&quot; and further operations will leave it unchanged. Hence, the minimized length is 3.&nbsp;\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 3:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;dddaaa&quot;\n<strong>Output:</strong> 2\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> For this, we can start with the character &#39;d&#39; at index 1. The closest occurrence of a &#39;d&#39; to its left is at index 0, and the closest occurrence of a &#39;d&#39; to its right is at index 2. We delete both index 0 and 2, so the string becomes &quot;daaa&quot;. In the new string, we can select the character &#39;a&#39; at index 2. The closest occurrence of an &#39;a&#39; to its left is at index 1, and the closest occurrence of an &#39;a&#39; to its right is at index 3. We delete both of them, and the string becomes &quot;da&quot;. We cannot minimize this further, so the minimized length is 2.\n</pre>\n\n<div class=\"notranslate\" style=\"all: initial;\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 100</code></li>\n\t<li><code>s</code> contains only lowercase English letters</li>\n</ul>\n",
