      "content": "<p>You are given a positive integer <strong>0-indexed</strong>&nbsp;array <code>nums</code>.</p>\n\n<p>A subset of the array <code>nums</code> is <strong>square-free</strong> if the product of its elements is a <strong>square-free integer</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>A <strong>square-free integer</strong> is an integer that is divisible by no square number other than <code>1</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>the number of square-free non-empty subsets of the array</em> <strong>nums</strong>. Since the answer may be too large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.</p>\n\n<p>A <strong>non-empty</strong>&nbsp;<strong>subset</strong> of <code>nums</code> is an array that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none but not all) elements from <code>nums</code>.

The product of its elements is 3, which is a square-free integer.\n- The subset consisting of the 3<sup>rd</sup> element [5]. The product of its elements is 5, which is a square-free integer.\n- The subset consisting of 0<sup>th</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> elements [3,5]. The product of its elements is 15, which is a square-free integer.\nIt can be proven that there are no more than 3 square-free subsets in the given array.</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [1]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 1\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> There is 1 square-free subset in this example:\n- The subset consisting of the 0<sup>th</sup> element [1]. The product of its elements is 1, which is a square-free integer.\nIt can be proven that there is no more than 1 square-free subset in the given array.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= nums.length&nbsp;&lt;= 1000</code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 30</code></li>\n</ul>\n",
