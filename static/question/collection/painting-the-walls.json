      "content": "<p>You are given two <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer arrays,&nbsp;<code>cost</code> and <code>time</code>, of size <code>n</code> representing the costs and the time taken to paint <code>n</code> different walls respectively. There are two painters available:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>A<strong>&nbsp;paid painter</strong>&nbsp;that paints the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> wall in <code>time[i]</code> units of time and takes <code>cost[i]</code> units of money.</li>\n\t<li>A<strong>&nbsp;free painter</strong> that paints&nbsp;<strong>any</strong> wall in <code>1</code> unit of time at a cost of <code>0</code>. But the&nbsp;free painter can only be used if the paid painter is already <strong>occupied</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Return <em>the minimum amount of money required to paint the </em><code>n</code><em>&nbsp;walls.</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> cost = [1,2,3,2], time = [1,2,3,2]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 3\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The walls at index 0 and 1 will be painted by the paid painter, and it will take 3 units of time; meanwhile, the free painter will paint the walls at index 2 and 3, free of cost in 2 units of time.
