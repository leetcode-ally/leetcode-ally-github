      "content": "<p>You are given a 2D integer array <code>ranges</code> where <code>ranges[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes that all integers between <code>start<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>end<sub>i</sub></code> (both <strong>inclusive</strong>) are contained in the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> range.</p>\n\n<p>You are to split <code>ranges</code> into <strong>two</strong> (possibly empty) groups such that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Each range belongs to exactly one group.</li>\n\t<li>Any two <strong>overlapping</strong> ranges must belong to the <strong>same</strong> group.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Two ranges are said to be <strong>overlapping</strong>&nbsp;if there exists at least <strong>one</strong> integer that is present in both ranges.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>For example, <code>[1, 3]</code> and <code>[2, 5]</code> are overlapping because <code>2</code> and <code>3</code> occur in both ranges.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Return <em>the <strong>total number</strong> of ways to split</em> <code>ranges</code> <em>into two groups</em>.

So, they must be in the same group.\nAgain, ranges [2,5] and [4,8] are also overlapping. So, they must also be in the same group. \nThus, there are four possible ways to group them:\n- All the ranges in group 1.\n- All the ranges in group 2.\n- Ranges [1,3], [2,5], and [4,8] in group 1 and [10,20] in group 2.\n- Ranges [1,3], [2,5], and [4,8] in group 2 and [10,20] in group 1.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= ranges.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>\n\t<li><code>ranges[i].length == 2</code></li>\n\t<li><code>0 &lt;= start<sub>i</sub> &lt;= end<sub>i</sub> &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup></code></li>\n</ul>\n",
