      "content": "<p>Given an <code>m x n</code> grid. Each cell of the grid has a sign pointing to the next cell you should visit if you are currently in this cell. The sign of <code>grid[i][j]</code> can be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1</code> which means go to the cell to the right. (i.e go from <code>grid[i][j]</code> to <code>grid[i][j + 1]</code>)</li>\n\t<li><code>2</code> which means go to the cell to the left. (i.e go from <code>grid[i][j]</code> to <code>grid[i][j - 1]</code>)</li>\n\t<li><code>3</code> which means go to the lower cell. (i.e go from <code>grid[i][j]</code> to <code>grid[i + 1][j]</code>)</li>\n\t<li><code>4</code> which means go to the upper cell. (i.e go from <code>grid[i][j]</code> to <code>grid[i - 1][j]</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Notice that there could be some signs on the cells of the grid that point outside the grid.</p>\n\n<p>You will initially start at the upper left cell <code>(0, 0)</code>. A valid path in the grid is a path that starts from the upper left cell <code>(0, 0)</code> and ends at the bottom-right cell <code>(m - 1, n - 1)</code> following the signs on the grid. The valid path does not have to be the shortest.</p>\n\n<p>You can modify the sign on a cell with <code>cost = 1</code>. You can modify the sign on a cell <strong>one time only</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>the minimum cost to make the grid have at least one valid path</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/13/grid1.png\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 390px;\" />\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> grid = [[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2],[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2]]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 3\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> You will start at point (0, 0).\nThe path to (3, 3) is as follows.
