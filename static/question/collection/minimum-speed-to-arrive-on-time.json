      "content": "<p>You are given a floating-point number <code>hour</code>, representing the amount of time you have to reach the office. To commute to the office, you must take <code>n</code> trains in sequential order. You are also given an integer array <code>dist</code> of length <code>n</code>, where <code>dist[i]</code> describes the distance (in kilometers) of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> train ride.</p>\n\n<p>Each train can only depart at an integer hour, so you may need to wait in between each train ride.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>For example, if the <code>1<sup>st</sup></code> train ride takes <code>1.5</code> hours, you must wait for an additional <code>0.5</code> hours before you can depart on the <code>2<sup>nd</sup></code> train ride at the 2 hour mark.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Return <em>the <strong>minimum positive integer</strong> speed <strong>(in kilometers per hour)</strong> that all the trains must travel at for you to reach the office on time, or </em><code>-1</code><em> if it is impossible to be on time</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Tests are generated such that the answer will not exceed <code>10<sup>7</sup></code> and <code>hour</code> will have <strong>at most two digits after the decimal point</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> dist = [1,3,2], hour = 6\n<strong>Output:</strong> 1\n<strong>Explanation: </strong>At speed 1:\n- The first train ride takes 1/1 = 1 hour.\n- Since we are already at an integer hour, we depart immediately at the 1 hour mark. The second train takes 3/1 = 3 hours.\n- Since we are already at an integer hour, we depart immediately at the 4 hour mark. The third train takes 2/1 = 2 hours.\n- You will arrive at exactly the 6 hour mark.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> dist = [1,3,2], hour = 2.7\n<strong>Output:</strong> 3\n<strong>Explanation: </strong>At speed 3:\n- The first train ride takes 1/3 = 0.33333 hours.\n- Since we are not at an integer hour, we wait until the 1 hour mark to depart. The second train ride takes 3/3 = 1 hour.\n- Since we are already at an integer hour, we depart immediately at the 2 hour mark. The third train takes 2/3 = 0.66667 hours.\n- You will arrive at the 2.66667 hour mark.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 3:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> dist = [1,3,2], hour = 1.9\n<strong>Output:</strong> -1\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> It is impossible because the earliest the third train can depart is at the 2 hour mark.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>n == dist.length</code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= dist[i] &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= hour &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup></code></li>\n\t<li>There will be at most two digits after the decimal point in <code>hour</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n",
