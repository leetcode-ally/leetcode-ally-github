      "content": "<p>You have two fruit baskets containing <code>n</code> fruits each. You are given two <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer arrays <code>basket1</code> and <code>basket2</code> representing the cost of fruit in each basket. You want to make both baskets <strong>equal</strong>. To do so, you can use the following operation as many times as you want:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Chose two indices <code>i</code> and <code>j</code>, and swap the <code>i<font size=\"1\">th</font>&nbsp;</code>fruit of <code>basket1</code> with the <code>j<font size=\"1\">th</font></code>&nbsp;fruit of <code>basket2</code>.</li>\n\t<li>The cost of the swap is <code>min(basket1[i],basket2[j])</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Two baskets are considered equal if sorting them according to the fruit cost makes them exactly the same baskets.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>the minimum cost to make both the baskets equal or </em><code>-1</code><em> if impossible.</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> basket1 = [4,2,2,2], basket2 = [1,4,1,2]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 1\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> Swap index 1 of basket1 with index 0 of basket2, which has cost 1. Now basket1 = [4,1,2,2] and basket2 = [2,4,1,2]. Rearranging both the arrays makes them equal.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> basket1 = [2,3,4,1], basket2 = [3,2,5,1]\n<strong>Output:</strong> -1\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> It can be shown that it is impossible to make both the baskets equal.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>basket1.length == basket2.length</code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= basket1.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= basket1[i],basket2[i]&nbsp;&lt;= 10<sup>9</sup></code></li>\n</ul>\n",
