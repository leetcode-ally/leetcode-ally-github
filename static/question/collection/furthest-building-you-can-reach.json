      "content": "<p>You are given an integer array <code>heights</code> representing the heights of buildings, some <code>bricks</code>, and some <code>ladders</code>.</p>\n\n<p>You start your journey from building <code>0</code> and move to the next building by possibly using bricks or ladders.</p>\n\n<p>While moving from building <code>i</code> to building <code>i+1</code> (<strong>0-indexed</strong>),</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>If the current building&#39;s height is <strong>greater than or equal</strong> to the next building&#39;s height, you do <strong>not</strong> need a ladder or bricks.</li>\n\t<li>If the current building&#39;s height is <b>less than</b> the next building&#39;s height, you can either use <strong>one ladder</strong> or <code>(h[i+1] - h[i])</code> <strong>bricks</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Return the furthest building index (0-indexed) you can reach if you use the given ladders and bricks optimally.</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/27/q4.gif\" style=\"width: 562px; height: 561px;\" />\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> heights = [4,2,7,6,9,14,12], bricks = 5, ladders = 1\n<strong>Output:</strong> 4\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> Starting at building 0, you can follow these steps:\n- Go to building 1 without using ladders nor bricks since 4 &gt;= 2.\n- Go to building 2 using 5 bricks.
