The <code>dungeon</code> consists of <code>m x n</code> rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight was initially positioned in <strong>the top-left room</strong> and must fight his way through <code>dungeon</code> to rescue the princess.</p>\n\n<p>The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to <code>0</code> or below, he dies immediately.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the rooms are guarded by demons (represented by negative integers), so the knight loses health upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (represented as 0) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight&#39;s health (represented by positive integers).</p>\n\n<p>To reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only <strong>rightward</strong> or <strong>downward</strong> in each step.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>the knight&#39;s minimum initial health so that he can rescue the princess</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong> that any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/13/dungeon-grid-1.jpg\" style=\"width: 253px; height: 253px;\" />\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> dungeon = [[-2,-3,3],[-5,-10,1],[10,30,-5]]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 7\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path: RIGHT-&gt; RIGHT -&gt; DOWN -&gt; DOWN.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> dungeon = [[0]]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 1\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>m == dungeon.length</code></li>\n\t<li><code>n == dungeon[i].length</code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= m, n &lt;= 200</code></li>\n\t<li><code>-1000 &lt;= dungeon[i][j] &lt;= 1000</code></li>\n</ul>\n",
