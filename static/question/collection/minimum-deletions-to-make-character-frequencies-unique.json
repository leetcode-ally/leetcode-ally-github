For example, in the string <code>&quot;aab&quot;</code>, the <strong>frequency</strong> of <code>&#39;a&#39;</code> is <code>2</code>, while the <strong>frequency</strong> of <code>&#39;b&#39;</code> is <code>1</code>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;aab&quot;\n<strong>Output:</strong> 0\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> <code>s</code> is already good.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;aaabbbcc&quot;\n<strong>Output:</strong> 2\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> You can delete two &#39;b&#39;s resulting in the good string &quot;aaabcc&quot;.\nAnother way it to delete one &#39;b&#39; and one &#39;c&#39; resulting in the good string &quot;aaabbc&quot;.</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 3:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;ceabaacb&quot;\n<strong>Output:</strong> 2\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> You can delete both &#39;c&#39;s resulting in the good string &quot;eabaab&quot;.\nNote that we only care about characters that are still in the string at the end (i.e. frequency of 0 is ignored).\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>\n\t<li><code>s</code>&nbsp;contains only lowercase English letters.</li>\n</ul>\n",
