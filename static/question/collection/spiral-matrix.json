        "Think about when you want to switch the progress on one of the indexes. If you progress on i out of [i, j], you'll shift in the same column. Similarly, by changing values for j, you'd be shifting in the same row.\r\nAlso, keep track of the end of a boundary so that you can move inwards and then keep repeating. It's always best to simulate edge cases like a single column or a single row to see if anything breaks or not."
