      "content": "<p>You are given two strings <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> that consist of lowercase letters. In one operation, you can change any character in <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> to <strong>any lowercase letter</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Your goal is to satisfy <strong>one</strong> of the following three conditions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Every</strong> letter in <code>a</code> is <strong>strictly less</strong> than <strong>every</strong> letter in <code>b</code> in the alphabet.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Every</strong> letter in <code>b</code> is <strong>strictly less</strong> than <strong>every</strong> letter in <code>a</code> in the alphabet.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Both</strong> <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> consist of <strong>only one</strong> distinct letter.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Return <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> number of operations needed to achieve your goal.</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> a = &quot;aba&quot;, b = &quot;caa&quot;\n<strong>Output:</strong> 2\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> Consider the best way to make each condition true:\n1) Change b to &quot;ccc&quot; in 2 operations, then every letter in a is less than every letter in b.\n2) Change a to &quot;bbb&quot; and b to &quot;aaa&quot; in 3 operations, then every letter in b is less than every letter in a.\n3) Change a to &quot;aaa&quot; and b to &quot;aaa&quot; in 2 operations, then a and b consist of one distinct letter.\nThe best way was done in 2 operations (either condition 1 or condition 3).\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> a = &quot;dabadd&quot;, b = &quot;cda&quot;\n<strong>Output:</strong> 3\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The best way is to make condition 1 true by changing b to &quot;eee&quot;.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= a.length, b.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>\n\t<li><code>a</code> and <code>b</code> consist only of lowercase letters.</li>\n</ul>\n",
