      "content": "<p>You are given a 2D integer array <code>grid</code> of size <code>m x n</code>, where each cell contains a positive integer.</p>\n\n<p>A <strong>cornered path</strong> is defined as a set of adjacent cells with <strong>at most</strong> one turn. More specifically, the path should exclusively move either <strong>horizontally</strong> or <strong>vertically</strong> up to the turn (if there is one), without returning to a previously visited cell. After the turn, the path will then move exclusively in the <strong>alternate</strong> direction: move vertically if it moved horizontally, and vice versa, also without returning to a previously visited cell.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>product</strong> of a path is defined as the product of all the values in the path.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> number of <strong>trailing zeros</strong> in the product of a cornered path found in </em><code>grid</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Note:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Horizontal</strong> movement means moving in either the left or right direction.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Vertical</strong> movement means moving in either the up or down direction.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/23/ex1new2.jpg\" style=\"width: 577px; height: 190px;\" />\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> grid = [[23,17,15,3,20],[8,1,20,27,11],[9,4,6,2,21],[40,9,1,10,6],[22,7,4,5,3]]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 3\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The grid on the left shows a valid cornered path.\nIt has a product of 15 * 20 * 6 * 1 * 10 = 18000 which has 3 trailing zeros.\nIt can be shown that this is the maximum trailing zeros in the product of a cornered path.\n\nThe grid in the middle is not a cornered path as it has more than one turn.\nThe grid on the right is not a cornered path as it requires a return to a previously visited cell.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/25/ex2.jpg\" style=\"width: 150px; height: 157px;\" />\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> grid = [[4,3,2],[7,6,1],[8,8,8]]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 0\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The grid is shown in the figure above.\nThere are no cornered paths in the grid that result in a product with a trailing zero.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>m == grid.length</code></li>\n\t<li><code>n == grid[i].length</code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= m, n &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= m * n &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= grid[i][j] &lt;= 1000</code></li>\n</ul>\n",
