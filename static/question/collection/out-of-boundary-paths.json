      "content": "<p>There is an <code>m x n</code> grid with a ball. The ball is initially at the position <code>[startRow, startColumn]</code>. You are allowed to move the ball to one of the four adjacent cells in the grid (possibly out of the grid crossing the grid boundary). You can apply <strong>at most</strong> <code>maxMove</code> moves to the ball.</p>\n\n<p>Given the five integers <code>m</code>, <code>n</code>, <code>maxMove</code>, <code>startRow</code>, <code>startColumn</code>, return the number of paths to move the ball out of the grid boundary. Since the answer can be very large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/28/out_of_boundary_paths_1.png\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 296px;\" />\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> m = 2, n = 2, maxMove = 2, startRow = 0, startColumn = 0\n<strong>Output:</strong> 6\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/28/out_of_boundary_paths_2.png\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 293px;\" />\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> m = 1, n = 3, maxMove = 3, startRow = 0, startColumn = 1\n<strong>Output:</strong> 12\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= m, n &lt;= 50</code></li>\n\t<li><code>0 &lt;= maxMove &lt;= 50</code></li>\n\t<li><code>0 &lt;= startRow &lt; m</code></li>\n\t<li><code>0 &lt;= startColumn &lt; n</code></li>\n</ul>\n",
