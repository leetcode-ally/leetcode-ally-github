            "content": "<p>You are given two <strong>1-indexed</strong> integer arrays, <code>nums</code> and, <code>changeIndices</code>, having lengths <code>n</code> and <code>m</code>, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>Initially, all indices in <code>nums</code> are unmarked. Your task is to mark <strong>all</strong> indices in <code>nums</code>.</p>\n\n<p>In each second, <code>s</code>, in order from <code>1</code> to <code>m</code> (<strong>inclusive</strong>), you can perform <strong>one</strong> of the following operations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Choose an index <code>i</code> in the range <code>[1, n]</code> and <strong>decrement</strong> <code>nums[i]</code> by <code>1</code>.</li>\n\t<li>Set <code>nums[changeIndices[s]]</code> to any <strong>non-negative</strong> value.</li>\n\t<li>Choose an index <code>i</code> in the range <code>[1, n]</code>, where <code>nums[i]</code> is <strong>equal</strong> to <code>0</code>, and <strong>mark</strong> index <code>i</code>.</li>\n\t<li>Do nothing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Return <em>an integer denoting the <strong>earliest second</strong> in the range </em><code>[1, m]</code><em> when <strong>all</strong> indices in </em><code>nums</code><em> can be marked by choosing operations optimally, or </em><code>-1</code><em> if it is impossible.</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [3,2,3], changeIndices = [1,3,2,2,2,2,3]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 6\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> In this example, we have 7 seconds. The following operations can be performed to mark all indices:\nSecond 1: Set nums[changeIndices[1]] to 0. nums becomes [0,2,3].\nSecond 2: Set nums[changeIndices[2]] to 0. nums becomes [0,2,0].\nSecond 3: Set nums[changeIndices[3]] to 0. nums becomes [0,0,0].\nSecond 4: Mark index 1, since nums[1] is equal to 0.\nSecond 5: Mark index 2, since nums[2] is equal to 0.\nSecond 6: Mark index 3, since nums[3] is equal to 0.\nNow all indices have been marked.\nIt can be shown that it is not possible to mark all indices earlier than the 6th second.\nHence, the answer is 6.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [0,0,1,2], changeIndices = [1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 7\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> In this example, we have 8 seconds.
