      "content": "<p>You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>tasks</code>, where <code>tasks[i]</code> represents the difficulty level of a task. In each round, you can complete either 2 or 3 tasks of the <strong>same difficulty level</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> rounds required to complete all the tasks, or </em><code>-1</code><em> if it is not possible to complete all the tasks.</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> tasks = [2,2,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 4\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> To complete all the tasks, a possible plan is:\n- In the first round, you complete 3 tasks of difficulty level 2. \n- In the second round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 3. \n- In the third round, you complete 3 tasks of difficulty level 4. \n- In the fourth round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 4.  \nIt can be shown that all the tasks cannot be completed in fewer than 4 rounds, so the answer is 4.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> tasks = [2,3,3]\n<strong>Output:</strong> -1\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> There is only 1 task of difficulty level 2, but in each round, you can only complete either 2 or 3 tasks of the same difficulty level. Hence, you cannot complete all the tasks, and the answer is -1.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= tasks.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= tasks[i] &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup></code></li>\n</ul>\n",
