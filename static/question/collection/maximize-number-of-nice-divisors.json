You are asked to construct a positive integer <code>n</code> that satisfies the following conditions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>The number of prime factors of <code>n</code> (not necessarily distinct) is <strong>at most</strong> <code>primeFactors</code>.</li>\r\n  <li>The number of nice divisors of <code>n</code> is maximized. Note that a divisor of <code>n</code> is <strong>nice</strong> if it is divisible by every prime factor of <code>n</code>. For example, if <code>n = 12</code>, then its prime factors are <code>[2,2,3]</code>, then <code>6</code> and <code>12</code> are nice divisors, while <code>3</code> and <code>4</code> are not.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Return <em>the number of nice divisors of</em> <code>n</code>. Since that number can be too large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that a prime number is a natural number greater than <code>1</code> that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.

        "The number of nice divisors is equal to the product of the count of each prime factor. Then the problem is reduced to: given n, find a sequence of numbers whose sum equals n and whose product is maximized.",
        "This sequence can have no numbers that are larger than 4. Proof: if it contains a number x that is larger than 4, then you can replace x with floor(x/2) and ceil(x/2), and floor(x/2) * ceil(x/2) > x. You can also replace 4s with two 2s. Hence, there will always be optimal solutions with only 2s and 3s.",
