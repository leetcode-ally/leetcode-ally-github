      "content": "<p>You are given the <code>head</code> of a linked list.</p>\n\n<p>The nodes in the linked list are <strong>sequentially</strong> assigned to <strong>non-empty</strong> groups whose lengths form the sequence of the natural numbers (<code>1, 2, 3, 4, ...</code>). The <strong>length</strong> of a group is the number of nodes assigned to it. In other words,</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The <code>1<sup>st</sup></code> node is assigned to the first group.</li>\n\t<li>The <code>2<sup>nd</sup></code> and the <code>3<sup>rd</sup></code> nodes are assigned to the second group.</li>\n\t<li>The <code>4<sup>th</sup></code>, <code>5<sup>th</sup></code>, and <code>6<sup>th</sup></code> nodes are assigned to the third group, and so on.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Note that the length of the last group may be less than or equal to <code>1 + the length of the second to last group</code>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reverse</strong> the nodes in each group with an <strong>even</strong> length, and return <em>the</em> <code>head</code> <em>of the modified linked list</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/25/eg1.png\" style=\"width: 699px; height: 124px;\" />\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> head = [5,2,6,3,9,1,7,3,8,4]\n<strong>Output:</strong> [5,6,2,3,9,1,4,8,3,7]\n<strong>Explanation:</strong>\n- The length of the first group is 1, which is odd, hence no reversal occurs.\n- The length of the second group is 2, which is even, hence the nodes are reversed.\n- The length of the third group is 3, which is odd, hence no reversal occurs.\n- The length of the last group is 4, which is even, hence the nodes are reversed.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/25/eg2.png\" style=\"width: 284px; height: 114px;\" />\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> head = [1,1,0,6]\n<strong>Output:</strong> [1,0,1,6]\n<strong>Explanation:</strong>\n- The length of the first group is 1.
