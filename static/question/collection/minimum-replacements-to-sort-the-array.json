In one operation you can replace any element of the array with <strong>any two</strong> elements that <strong>sum</strong> to it.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>For example, consider <code>nums = [5,6,7]</code>. In one operation, we can replace <code>nums[1]</code> with <code>2</code> and <code>4</code> and convert <code>nums</code> to <code>[5,2,4,7]</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Return <em>the minimum number of operations to make an array that is sorted in <strong>non-decreasing</strong> order</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [3,9,3]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 2\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> Here are the steps to sort the array in non-decreasing order:\n- From [3,9,3], replace the 9 with 3 and 6 so the array becomes [3,3,6,3]\n- From [3,3,6,3], replace the 6 with 3 and 3 so the array becomes [3,3,3,3,3]\nThere are 2 steps to sort the array in non-decreasing order. Therefore, we return 2.\n\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [1,2,3,4,5]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 0\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The array is already in non-decreasing order.
