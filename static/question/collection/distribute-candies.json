      "content": "<p>Alice has <code>n</code> candies, where the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> candy is of type <code>candyType[i]</code>. Alice noticed that she started to gain weight, so she visited a doctor.</p>\n\n<p>The doctor advised Alice to only eat <code>n / 2</code> of the candies she has (<code>n</code> is always even). Alice likes her candies very much, and she wants to eat the maximum number of different types of candies while still following the doctor&#39;s advice.</p>\n\n<p>Given the integer array <code>candyType</code> of length <code>n</code>, return <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> number of different types of candies she can eat if she only eats </em><code>n / 2</code><em> of them</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> candyType = [1,1,2,2,3,3]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 3\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> Alice can only eat 6 / 2 = 3 candies. Since there are only 3 types, she can eat one of each type.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> candyType = [1,1,2,3]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 2\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> Alice can only eat 4 / 2 = 2 candies. Whether she eats types [1,2], [1,3], or [2,3], she still can only eat 2 different types.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 3:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> candyType = [6,6,6,6]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 1\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> Alice can only eat 4 / 2 = 2 candies. Even though she can eat 2 candies, she only has 1 type.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>n == candyType.length</code></li>\n\t<li><code>2 &lt;= n &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>\n\t<li><code>n</code>&nbsp;is even.</li>\n\t<li><code>-10<sup>5</sup> &lt;= candyType[i] &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>\n</ul>\n",
