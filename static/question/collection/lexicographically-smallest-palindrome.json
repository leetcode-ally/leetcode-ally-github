      "content": "<p>You are given a string <code node=\"[object Object]\">s</code> consisting of <strong>lowercase English letters</strong>, and you are allowed to perform operations on it. In one operation, you can <strong>replace</strong> a character in <code node=\"[object Object]\">s</code> with another lowercase English letter.</p>\n\n<p>Your task is to make <code node=\"[object Object]\">s</code> a <strong>palindrome</strong> with the <strong>minimum</strong> <strong>number</strong> <strong>of operations</strong> possible. If there are <strong>multiple palindromes</strong> that can be <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />made using the <strong>minimum</strong> number of operations, <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />make the <strong>lexicographically smallest</strong> one.</p>\n\n<p>A string <code>a</code> is lexicographically smaller than a string <code>b</code> (of the same length) if in the first position where <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> differ, string <code>a</code> has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in <code>b</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>the resulting palindrome string.</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;egcfe&quot;\n<strong>Output:</strong> &quot;efcfe&quot;\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The minimum number of operations to make &quot;egcfe&quot; a palindrome is 1, and the lexicographically smallest palindrome string we can get by modifying one character is &quot;efcfe&quot;, by changing &#39;g&#39;.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;abcd&quot;\n<strong>Output:</strong> &quot;abba&quot;\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The minimum number of operations to make &quot;abcd&quot; a palindrome is 2, and the lexicographically smallest palindrome string we can get by modifying two characters is &quot;abba&quot;.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 3:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;seven&quot;\n<strong>Output:</strong> &quot;neven&quot;\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The minimum number of operations to make &quot;seven&quot; a palindrome is 1, and the lexicographically smallest palindrome string we can get by modifying one character is &quot;neven&quot;.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 1000</code></li>\n\t<li><code>s</code>&nbsp;consists of only lowercase English letters<b>.</b></li>\n</ul>\n",
