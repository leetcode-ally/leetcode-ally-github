      "content": "<p>A newly designed keypad was tested, where a tester pressed a sequence of <code>n</code> keys, one at a time.</p>\n\n<p>You are given a string <code>keysPressed</code> of length <code>n</code>, where <code>keysPressed[i]</code> was the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> key pressed in the testing sequence, and a sorted list <code>releaseTimes</code>, where <code>releaseTimes[i]</code> was the time the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> key was released. Both arrays are <strong>0-indexed</strong>. The <code>0<sup>th</sup></code> key was pressed at the time <code>0</code>,&nbsp;and every subsequent key was pressed at the <strong>exact</strong> time the previous key was released.</p>\n\n<p>The tester wants to know the key of the keypress that had the <strong>longest duration</strong>. The <code>i<sup>th</sup></code><sup> </sup>keypress had a <strong>duration</strong> of <code>releaseTimes[i] - releaseTimes[i - 1]</code>, and the <code>0<sup>th</sup></code> keypress had a duration of <code>releaseTimes[0]</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the same key could have been pressed multiple times during the test, and these multiple presses of the same key <strong>may not</strong> have had the same <strong>duration</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Return the key of the keypress that had the <strong>longest duration</strong>.
