      "content": "<p>You are given an array <code>time</code> where <code>time[i]</code> denotes the time taken by the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> bus to complete <strong>one trip</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Each bus can make multiple trips <strong>successively</strong>; that is, the next trip can start <strong>immediately after</strong> completing the current trip. Also, each bus operates <strong>independently</strong>; that is, the trips of one bus do not influence the trips of any other bus.</p>\n\n<p>You are also given an integer <code>totalTrips</code>, which denotes the number of trips all buses should make <strong>in total</strong>. Return <em>the <strong>minimum time</strong> required for all buses to complete <strong>at least</strong> </em><code>totalTrips</code><em> trips</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> time = [1,2,3], totalTrips = 5\n<strong>Output:</strong> 3\n<strong>Explanation:</strong>\n- At time t = 1, the number of trips completed by each bus are [1,0,0]. \n  The total number of trips completed is 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.\n- At time t = 2, the number of trips completed by each bus are [2,1,0]. \n  The total number of trips completed is 2 + 1 + 0 = 3.\n- At time t = 3, the number of trips completed by each bus are [3,1,1]. \n  The total number of trips completed is 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.\nSo the minimum time needed for all buses to complete at least 5 trips is 3.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> time = [2], totalTrips = 1\n<strong>Output:</strong> 2\n<strong>Explanation:</strong>\nThere is only one bus, and it will complete its first trip at t = 2.\nSo the minimum time needed to complete 1 trip is 2.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= time.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= time[i], totalTrips &lt;= 10<sup>7</sup></code></li>\n</ul>\n",
