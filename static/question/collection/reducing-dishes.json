Chef can cook any dish in 1 unit of time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Like-time coefficient</strong> of a dish is defined as the time taken to cook that dish including previous dishes multiplied by its satisfaction level i.e. <code>time[i] * satisfaction[i]</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Return the maximum sum of <strong>like-time coefficient </strong>that the chef can obtain after preparing some amount of dishes.</p>\n\n<p>Dishes can be prepared in <strong>any </strong>order and the chef can discard some dishes to get this maximum value.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> satisfaction = [-1,-8,0,5,-9]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 14\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> After Removing the second and last dish, the maximum total <strong>like-time coefficient</strong> will be equal to (-1*1 + 0*2 + 5*3 = 14).\nEach dish is prepared in one unit of time.</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> satisfaction = [4,3,2]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 20\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> Dishes can be prepared in any order, (2*1 + 3*2 + 4*3 = 20)\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 3:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> satisfaction = [-1,-4,-5]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 0\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> People do not like the dishes.
