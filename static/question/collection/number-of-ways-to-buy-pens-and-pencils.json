You are also given two integers <code>cost1</code> and <code>cost2</code> indicating the price of a pen and pencil respectively. You can spend <strong>part or all</strong> of your money to buy multiple quantities (or none) of each kind of writing utensil.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>the <strong>number of distinct ways</strong> you can buy some number of pens and pencils.</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> total = 20, cost1 = 10, cost2 = 5\n<strong>Output:</strong> 9\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The price of a pen is 10 and the price of a pencil is 5.\n- If you buy 0 pens, you can buy 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 pencils.\n- If you buy 1 pen, you can buy 0, 1, or 2 pencils.\n- If you buy 2 pens, you cannot buy any pencils.\nThe total number of ways to buy pens and pencils is 5 + 3 + 1 = 9.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> total = 5, cost1 = 10, cost2 = 10\n<strong>Output:</strong> 1\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The price of both pens and pencils are 10, which cost more than total, so you cannot buy any writing utensils. Therefore, there is only 1 way: buy 0 pens and 0 pencils.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= total, cost1, cost2 &lt;= 10<sup>6</sup></code></li>\n</ul>\n",
